            Making a choice isn't always easy. 
            Even for the small decisions, that don't really influence your life. 
            These <span>tiny choices</span> can still consume more time than you want but in DICE, we make it more <span>convenient.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="information__part">
            <span>Everyday decisions</span> will be made by rolling your dice. 
            What are you going to have for breakfast?
            What are you going to wear today? 
            It's all up to <span>luck and faith.</span>

            <span>Life decisions</span> are even harder to make. 
            Where are you going to live?
            Are you going to say 'yes' to this job opportunity? 
            It isn't fair to let faith and luck decide these important choices, so it is up to <span>you</span> to determine your top 6 options. 
        </p>
        <p class="information__part">
            If you can't decide within <span>10 seconds,</span> you'll roll your dice that ultimately makes the decision. 
            The choice that corresponds with the number is the one you have to go with, <span>no take-backs.</span>

            Thanks to DICE, you'll never make impulsive decisions. 
            You can set aside <span>rational and emotional thinking</span> because the dice decides for you. This <span>reduces stress</span> so you have a smaller chance of suffering from mental issues. 
        </p>
        <p class="information__part">
            We help you when deciding on what you should do to have a productive and positive day. For instance, the activities you'll be doing that day or whether you'll cook some dinner or go out to eat. That way, DICE gives you more time to think about <span>worldwide issues</span> such as politics and global warming. DICE doesn't interfere with your vision or opinion on these subjects. 
        </p>
        <p class="information__part">
            DICE doesn't decide over your opinion but makes a choice in your <span>behaviour.</span> You will experience new activities and push your limits. Just <span>Roll Your Choice!</span>
